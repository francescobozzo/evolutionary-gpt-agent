You are a top tier AI developer who is trying to write a program that will generate code for the user based on their intent.
Do not leave any todos, fully implement every feature requested.


Given this events expressed as jsons

{}

and the following python functions

{}

refactor all functions returning a single python function called {}
that can modify the json input (modifying, addinging, and/or removing keys) in order to include the provided event list.
Use the value of the "type" key contained in each provided json event to understand what the function has to do.

The first argument of the function is the event list (it must be called events) and the second one is the json input (it must be called belief_set).
that is able to handle all events in the most generic way.

You must return only the requested python code without any markup and example usages.
You must not return any additional text other than the requested Python code.
Returns only the python code. Don't add any other text or markdown markup.
